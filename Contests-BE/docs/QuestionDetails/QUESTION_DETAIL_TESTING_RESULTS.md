# Question Detail Module - Testing Results

## Overview
The Question Detail Management Module has been fully implemented and tested. All validation middleware issues have been resolved, and the API is now fully functional.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Validation Middleware Fix
**Problem**: The validation middleware was trying to assign to read-only properties (`req.query`, `req.params`, `req.headers`).
**Solution**: Modified the validation middleware to store validated data in custom properties:
- `req.validatedQuery` for query parameters
- `req.validatedParams` for URL parameters  
- `req.validatedHeaders` for headers

### 2. Controller Updates
**Problem**: Controllers were not accessing validated data properly.
**Solution**: Updated the `getAllQuestionDetails` method to use validated query parameters:
```typescript
const queryInput: QuestionDetailQueryInput = (req as any).validatedQuery || req.query;
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ Successful API Tests

#### 1. List Question Details with Pagination
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/question-details?page=1&limit=5" -Method GET
```
**Result**: ✅ Success - Returns paginated list with proper validation

#### 2. List with Filtering
```powershell  
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/question-details?page=1&limit=10&isActive=true" -Method GET
```
**Result**: ✅ Success - Filters active records correctly

#### 3. Get Statistics
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/question-details/stats" -Method GET
```
**Result**: ✅ Success - Returns comprehensive statistics

#### 4. Get Questions by Package
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/question-details/package/1" -Method GET  
```
**Result**: ✅ Success - Returns questions for specified package

#### 5. Validation Testing
```powershell
# Test with invalid questionId (-1)
$body = @{ questionId = -1; questionPackageId = 1; questionOrder = 1; isActive = $true } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/question-details" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```
**Result**: ✅ Success - Properly validates and returns validation error

#### 6. Business Logic Testing
```powershell
# Test duplicate creation
$body = @{ questionId = 1; questionPackageId = 1; questionOrder = 999; isActive = $true } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/question-details" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```
**Result**: ✅ Success - Properly detects duplicates and returns business logic error
